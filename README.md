## What is SnapLens?

People take screenshots of assignments, payments, notes, and links — but they get buried and forgotten. SnapLens uses AI to:

1. **Read** screenshot text (OCR)
2. **Understand** why you saved it (LLM intent detection)
3. **Suggest** a meaningful action
4. **Store** it as structured memory (task / note / reminder / expense / link)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI
- **OCR:** Tesseract
- **LLM:** Gemini / OpenAI API
- **Database:** SQLite (MVP)
- **Frontend:** HTML + JS + Tailwind CSS
- **Extension:** Chrome Manifest v3
